        <p>Rush is a Canadian rock band that was originally formed in Toronto in 1968.
            The original band members were Alex Lifeson, John Rutsey, and Jeff Jones.
            Jones was quickly replaced by Geddy Lee who specialized in bass, vocals, keyboards, and music composition.
            Then, in 1974, Rutsey was replaced by drummer Neil Peart who went on to become legendary as Rush continued
